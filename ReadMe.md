## Overview

Week 2 dives into the concepts that make Java an object-oriented language. From defining classes and creating objects to understanding inheritance and polymorphism, this week focuses on developing modular, reusable, and scalable code using OOP best practices.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Java Classes and Objects

- Defining classes and creating objects
- Fields and methods
- Accessing object data and behavior
- Real-life analogy of classes and objects

### Day 2: Constructors, Variables, and Access Modifiers

- Types of constructors (default, parameterized)
- Instance vs. class (static) variables
- `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default access modifiers
- Constructor overloading

### Day 3: Keywords and Operators

- `this` keyword and its usage
- `static` keyword for variables and methods
- `final` keyword for variables, methods, and classes
- `instanceof` operator and its role in type checking

### Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagram

- Basics of object modeling in software development
- Understanding and creating class diagrams
- Relationships: association, aggregation, composition

### Day 5: Inheritance

- Concept and purpose of inheritance
- `extends` keyword
- Method overriding
- `super` keyword

### Day 6: OOP Principles

- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal data via access modifiers and getter/setter methods
- **Interface**: Defining contract-based behavior
- **Abstract Classes**: Shared base functionality with abstract methods
- **Polymorphism**: Compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding)
